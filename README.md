# Spotify Like

Idea proudly yoinked from [AlaaZorkane](https://github.com/AlaaZorkane/) as detailed in [this notion](https://www.notion.so/difys/Spotify-Liked-Songs-7a6e846c7f3e4b2c880e90888090b917).

## Still in BETA
Open an issue with your spotify email to be invited to the beta, sill waiting for Spotify to accept the quota extension request.

## The problem:

Your **"Liked Songs"** playlist is a private playlist, unlike other playlists it can't be public

- You can't share it
- People can't see it
- It doesn't appear on your profile

## The Workaround (only on PC)

- Manually selecting all songs in your Liked Songs playlist and adding them to a separate playlist

### Problems:

- Each time you add a song to your Liked Songs, you'd have to redo the workaround
- When you add a song it's added to the last entry (making harder to navigate)
- Bad UX

## The solution (WIP)

- Login using your spotify account
- Create a playlist
- Wait, the webapp will create a spotify playlist and sync your liked songs everyday at 12AM.
